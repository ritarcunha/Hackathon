# NightofOzManager

## Project Description
**NightofOzManager** is an application developed with the goal of ensuring that a group of friends can enjoy a night out with safety and responsibility. The main idea of the project is to create an environment where everyone has fun while one or more people in the group take on a more responsible role, periodically checking on the state of each group member.

The app is inspired by Dorothy's journey in **The Wizard of Oz**, where, just like Dorothy, users embark on a night adventure, meeting new people and facing challenges, but always keeping safety in mind.

## Features
- **Night Guardians**: The app allows the group to assign one or more members who will be responsible for ensuring everyone's well-being throughout the night. These people are identified as those who chose not to drink and are fully capable of monitoring the group.
  
- **Wellness Check**: The app periodically asks the group members wellness questions to check on their physical and emotional state, ensuring everyone is safe and having a good time.
  
- **Group Monitoring**: The designated guardian can track each group member's status, making sure no one gets lost or injured.

- **Night Adventure**: Just like Dorothy, users are encouraged to live their own "adventure" throughout the night, but with the reassurance that there is always someone available to help if needed.
